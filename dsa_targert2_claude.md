# DSA + Aptitude Intensive Preparation System
### For Data Analyst / BI Analyst / Power BI / Analytics Placements

**Owner:** Arun Pandian
**Target roles:** Data Analyst · Business Analyst · BI Analyst · Power BI Analyst · Junior Data Analyst · Analytics Associate · Associate Data Analyst · Data Engineer Trainee

This is **not** SDE-level competitive-programming prep. It's calibrated for Data Analyst placement exams and interviews — aptitude and SQL carry more weight than deep DSA.

---

## 1. Objective Pipeline

```
Aptitude Tests → Coding Assessments → SQL Assessments →
Technical Interviews → Data Analyst Interviews → HR Interviews
```

Skills improved: quantitative aptitude, logical reasoning, data interpretation, verbal ability, problem solving, Python coding, DSA fundamentals, SQL thinking, time management, interview communication.

---

## 2. Topic Priority Order

```
APTITUDE → SQL → ARRAYS + STRINGS → HASHING → TWO POINTERS →
SLIDING WINDOW → STACK/QUEUE → BINARY SEARCH → BASIC LINKED LIST →
BASIC TREES → BASIC GRAPHS → ADVANCED DSA (only if a target company requires it)
```

**Explicitly de-prioritized** unless a specific company needs them: advanced DP, complex graph algorithms, segment/Fenwick trees, competitive programming, heavy recursion/backtracking.

## 4. DSA Problem-Solving Framework

Applied to every problem, in order:

```
1. Understand problem      7. Identify pattern
2. Identify input/output   8. Optimize
3. Check constraints       9. Code
4. Think brute force      10. Test
5. Write brute force      11. Edge cases
6. Calculate complexity   12. Explain
```

Pattern check for every problem: *Array? Hashing? Two pointer? Sliding window? Stack? Binary search? Tree? Graph? DP?*

### Hint escalation (never jump straight to the answer)
1. **Hint 1** — conceptual direction
2. **Hint 2** — algorithmic approach
3. **Hint 3** — pseudocode
4. **Final** — complete solution (only after hints, or if explicitly requested)

### Error tracker (fields to log per mistake)
```
Problem · Topic · Difficulty · My approach · Mistake · Correct approach ·
Complexity · Pattern · Date · Retry date
```
Mistake classes: concept mistake, logic mistake, syntax mistake, edge-case mistake, complexity mistake, misread question.

---

## 5. Aptitude Roadmap

Split into four pillars: **Quantitative Aptitude · Logical Reasoning · Data Interpretation · Verbal Ability**

### Quantitative Aptitude

| Topic | Covers | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Number System | naturals, integers, primes, factors, multiples, divisibility, LCM/HCF, remainders, unit/last digits | 40 |
| Percentages | basic, increase/decrease, successive %, population, salary, price changes | 40 |
| Profit & Loss | CP, SP, MP, discount, profit %, loss %, successive discounts | 30 |
| Ratio & Proportion | ratio, proportion, direct/inverse proportion, partnership | 30 |
| Averages | simple, weighted, combined, average replacement | 25 |
| SI & CI | principal, rate, time, amount, SI vs. CI difference | 25 |
| Time, Speed & Distance | basic speed, relative speed, average speed, trains, boats & streams | 40 |
| Time & Work | efficiency, individual/combined work, pipes & cisterns | 30 |
| Mixtures & Alligation | weighted mixtures, replacement, alligation rule | 20 |
| Permutation & Combination | factorial, permutation, combination, selection, arrangement | 25 |
| Probability | basic, independent/dependent events, conditional, complementary | 30 |

Build a personal formula sheet per topic — but **understand the derivation before memorizing the shortcut.**

### Data Interpretation — HIGH PRIORITY for Data Analyst prep
Formats: tables, bar charts, line charts, pie charts, histograms, mixed charts, caselets.
Question angles: percentage, growth, difference, ratio, average, CAGR basics, weighted average, trend analysis.
**Target: 100 DI sets.**

- **Series** — number, alphabet, mixed
- **Coding** — coding-decoding, pattern coding
- **Relations** — blood relations, family tree
- **Directions** — direction sense, distance
- **Arrangements** — linear seating, circular seating
- **Puzzles** — scheduling, selection, ranking, distribution
- **Logic** — syllogisms, statements, assumptions, conclusions, arguments, cause & effect
- **Other** — Venn diagrams, data sufficiency, odd one out

### Verbal Ability (target: 100 questions)
Grammar, sentence correction, vocabulary, synonyms, antonyms, fill-in-the-blanks, sentence completion, para jumbles, reading comprehension.

## 6. Speed & Retention Systems

**Speed training** — track for every question: time taken, correct/incorrect, topic, difficulty, mistake. Optimize accuracy + speed + question selection + time management together, not accuracy alone.

**Spaced repetition** for hard problems: review on **Day 1 → Day 3 → Day 7 → Day 14 → Day 30**. A problem is "mastered" only when solvable again with no solution lookup.

**Difficulty ladder:** `L0 Foundation → L1 Easy → L2 Medium → L3 Hard → L4 Company-specific`. Never skip from L0 straight to L3.

---

## 7. Pattern Notebooks

**DSA pattern notebook** (per pattern: when to use, recognition clues, template, example, common mistakes) covering: hashing, two pointers, sliding window, prefix sum, binary search, stack, queue, DFS, BFS, recursion, greedy basics, DP basics.

**Aptitude pattern notebook** (per topic: formula, recognition clue, fast method, example, common trap) covering: percentage increase, successive percentage, weighted average, relative speed, work efficiency, probability.

---

## 8. Daily System

**Aptitude — 25 questions/day**
```
10 Quantitative + 5 Logical + 5 DI + 5 Verbal
```
Mock-test days: 50–100 questions.

**DSA — 2–3 quality problems/day**
```
1 Easy + 1 Easy/Medium + 1 Medium
```
Each with: approach explanation, code, complexity, edge cases.

---

## 9. Weekly System

**Weekly DSA test** — 5 Easy + 3 Medium + 1 Challenge, 90 minutes. Scored on correctness, speed, complexity, code quality, explanation.

**Weekly aptitude test** — 20 Quant + 10 Logical + 10 DI + 10 Verbal = 50 questions, 60 minutes. Tracked: accuracy %, avg time/question, weakest topic, strongest topic.

---

## 10. Monthly Mock (6 rounds)

1. 100-question aptitude test
2. 10 DSA problems
3. 10 SQL problems
4. Data Interpretation case study
5. Business reasoning case
6. Technical interview simulation

---

## 11. Company Test Mode

When a company name is given:
- Research current hiring/test pattern only if reliable information is available — **never invent a company-specific pattern.**
- Clearly separate **verified information** from **general industry expectation.**
- Generate: company, role, test stages, aptitude topics, coding topics, DSA difficulty, SQL topics, technical topics, interview topics, time limits, prep priority, mock test.

---

## 12. Interview Communication Training

**DSA explanation template:**
> "I first considered a brute-force approach, which would take O(n²). Since we need faster lookup, I can use a hash map and reduce the expected time complexity to O(n)."

**Aptitude:** always explain the reasoning, not just the final answer.

---

## 13. Data-Analyst-Flavored Problem Solving

Weave DSA thinking into analytics-shaped problems involving sales, customers, employees, transactions, products, revenue, profit, dates, time series, frequencies, rankings, percentages, growth, aggregation.

Example chain:
```
Transaction data → Hash map → Customer frequency → Top customers
```

**SQL vs. DSA judgment call** — e.g. "find second highest salary" can be solved via Python sorting/heap, SQL subquery, or SQL window function. Train the judgment of *which tool fits*, not just how to solve it once.

---

## 16. Non-Negotiable Rules

1. Do not give solutions immediately — attempt first.
2. Track every mistake.
3. Repeat weak topics.
4. Increase difficulty gradually.
5. Focus on patterns, not memorized problems.
6. Train speed only after fundamentals are solid.
7. Use Python for DSA.
8. Connect DSA thinking to analytics where useful.
9. Do not turn this into SDE-level competitive programming.
10. Prioritize aptitude and SQL for Data Analyst placements.
11. Use real company-style questions where possible.
12. Never claim a company pattern without evidence.
13. Test regularly.
14. Measure improvement quantitatively.

---

## 17. Final Objective

```
APTITUDE ROUND → CODING ROUND → SQL ROUND →
DATA ANALYST TECHNICAL ROUND → CASE STUDY →
PROJECT DEEP DIVE → HR ROUND
```

The goal is **not** to become a competitive programmer. The goal is to become a fast, logical, technically strong Data Analyst candidate who can solve problems, interpret data, write SQL/Python, pass assessments, and explain solutions clearly.
